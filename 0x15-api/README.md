An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of defined rules that enable different applications to communicate with each other. It acts as an intermediary layer that processes data transfers between systems, letting companies open their application data and functionality to external third-party developers, business partners, and internal departments within their companies1. APIs can control access to hardware and software resources2. Is there anything specific you would like to know about APIs?
